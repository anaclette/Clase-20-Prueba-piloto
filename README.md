# Online shopping store

## Second project for Ada ITW 

This is the 2nd challenge that Ada Institute prepared for us: an online shopping store, this time implementing JavaScript programming language. I couldn't be more grateful for these last weeks, as I feel like my technical skills were taken to a whole different level, and it's certainly the most rewarding experience that 2020 isolation circumstances indulged me with to keep my spirit going!. If this is just a 2 months result, I can't dare to imagine what comes ahead in this training course.
You might want to take a look at the online store model we were based on, in terms of structure, JS code and so forth: [https://frontend-proyecto-tienda.adaitw.org/].
